# SPL Token Minting & Metadata Integration

This project demonstrates how to mint Solana Program Library (SPL) tokens with custom metadata using **Metaplex** integration. The scripts provided allow you to mint SPL tokens, add metadata such as images and descriptions, and handle token transfers, all in a seamless workflow.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The goal of this repository is to show how to interact with the Solana blockchain for minting SPL tokens, integrating metadata using Metaplex, and providing utility functions for transfers and token management. Whether youâ€™re creating tokens for a project or a community, this repository provides the essential steps to get started.

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, you need to have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended: LTS version)
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- [Metaplex CLI](https://docs.metaplex.com/cli) (for metadata handling)

Additionally, you'll need:

- A **Solana wallet** with SOL for transaction fees.
- A **mint address** for token minting.

## ðŸ’» Install Dependencies

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevJProd/spl-token-minting-ts.git
